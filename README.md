# About
This repository contains a computational model of the cortico-basal ganglia loop, capable of recording local field
potentials (LFP) from the subthalamic nucleus (STN), as well as delivering deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the same
location. The original model was presented in the article by Fleming et al.,
available at https://doi.org/10.3171/2023.2.JNS222576

# Changes from the original model
- The model run twice with the same random seed produces numerically identical results
- This model is MPI-enabled, which means it can be run in parallel, reducing the simulation time
- The simulation parameters are set with a config file that is passed as a command line argument
  to the `run_model.py` script

# Running the model
Install Docker and build the image using included dockerfile
```
docker build -t fleming-model .
```
Run the code in the container
```
docker run --name <container-name> fleming-model <config_file>.yml
```
If you don't specify the config file (relative to the Cortex_BasalGanglia_DBS_model directory),
by default ```conf_zero_4s.yml``` will be run.

Get the simulation data out from the container
```
docker cp <container-name>:/usr/app/src/CBG_Fleming_Model/RESULTS ./simulation-results
```

Several scripts to help with data loading and plotting are available in the following repository:
https://github.com/silvanx/FlemingModelResultAnalysis

If you want to run the simulations directly from your OS, use the dockerfile as the guide with respect to dependencies
and their required versions.

# Config file
The config file specifies the parameters of the simulation 
## Simulation 
- `RandomSeed`: seed for the RNG
- `TimeStep`: timestep of the NEURON simulator
- `SteadyStateDuration`: how long to wait before applying stimulation; unit: ms
- `RunTime`: how long to run the simulation *after* steady state; unit: ms
- `save_stn_voltage`: whether to write STN neuron membrane voltage to a file
- `save_ctx_voltage`: whether to write cortical neuron membrane voltage to a file
- `save_ctx_lfp`: whether to write cortical neuron synaptic currents to a file
## Model
- `Pop_size`: how many neurons per cell population
- `create_new_network`: should I create a new model or read the structure from a file? (default: False)
- `beta_burst_modulation_scale`: amplitude of the modulating current in cortical neurons; unit: nA
- `ctx_dc_offset`: constant current applied to cortical neurons; unit: nA
- `ctx_slow_modulation_step_count`: how many times during the simulation to switch ctx input from `0` to `ctx_slow_modulation_amplitude`
- `ctx_slow_modulation_amplitude`: amplitude of slow cortical modulation
## Controller
- `setpoint`: target value of the biomarker
- `td`:
- `ts`: time between subsequent controller calls; unit: s
- `min_value`: minimum value of controller output
- `max_value`: maximum value of controller output
- `controller_window_length`: length of time on which the biomarker value is calculated; unit: ms
- `controller_window_tail_length`: length of the tail which is ignored for calculating biomarker to avoid edge effects; unit: ms
### PID controller settings
- `kp`: proportional gain
- `ti`: integral constant

### IFT controller settings
- `kp`: initial proportional gain
- `ti`: initial integral constant
- `stage_length`: duration of the "experiment"; unit: s
- `gamma`: regulates gradient descent speed
- `lam`: lambda parameter, weighting the MSE and TEED parts of the fitness function
- `min_kp`: minimal value of kp
- `min_ti`: minimal value of ti 

### OPEN controller settings
- `stimulation_amplitude`: amplitude of the open-loop stimulation
